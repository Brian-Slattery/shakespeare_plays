<p>"Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
    I come to <strong>bury</strong> Caesar, not to praise him.
    The <strong>evil</strong> that men do lives after them;
    The <strong>good</strong> is oft interred with their bones;
    So let it be with Caesar."</p>
<li><h2 class="CAEtitles">Brutish Beasts</h2></li>
<p>"I speak not to <strong>disprove</strong> what Brutus spoke,
    But here I am to speak what <strong>I do know</strong>.
    You all did love him once, not without cause:
    What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?
    O judgment! thou art fled to <strong>brutish</strong> beasts,
    And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;
    My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,
    And I must pause till it come back to me."</p>
