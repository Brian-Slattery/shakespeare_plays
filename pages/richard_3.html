    <p>"<strong>Plots</strong> have I laid, inductions dangerous,
        By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,
        To set my brother Clarence and the king
        In <strong>deadly</strong> hate the one against the other:</p>
        <p>And if King Edward be as <b>true</b> and <b>just</b>
            As I am <b>subtle, false</b> and <b>treacherous</b>,
            This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,
            About a prophecy, which says that 'G'
            Of Edward's heirs the <strong>murderer</strong> shall be.
            Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here
            Clarence comes."</p>

            <p> What, I that <strong>killed</strong> her husband and his father, To take her in her heart's extremest hate, With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes, The bleeding witness of my hatred by,</p>
             <p>Having God, her conscience, and these bars against me, And I no friends to back my suit at all But the plain devil and dissembling looks? And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!"</p>
