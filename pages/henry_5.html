<li><h2>St. Crispian's Day.</h2></li>
<p>"This day is called the <strong>feast of Crispian</strong>
He that outlives this day, and comes safe home
Will stand a tip-toe when the day is named,
And rouse him at the name of <strong>Crispian</strong>.
He that shall live this day, and see old age,
Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbors,
And say 'To-morrow is <strong>Saint Crispian</strong>'
Then will he strip his sleeve and show his <strong>scars</strong>.
And say 'These wounds I had on <strong>Crispin's day"</strong>.</p>
<li><h2>Band Of Brother</h2></li>
<p>"We few, we happy few, we /<strong>band of brothers</strong>;
    For he to-day that <strong>sheds his blood</strong> with me
    Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so <strong>vile</strong>,
    This day shall <strong>gentle his condition</strong>."</p>
