        <p>"No matter where; of comfort no man speak:
        Let's talk of <strong>graves</strong>, of worms, and epitaphs;
        Make dust our paper and with rainy eyes
        Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth,
        Let's choose executors and talk of wills:
        And yet not so, for what can we bequeath
        Save our <strong>deposed bodies</strong> to the ground?</p>
        <p>Our lands, our lives and all are <strong>Bolingbroke's</strong>,
        And nothing can we call our own but <strong>death</strong>
        And that small model of the barren earth
        Which serves as paste and cover to our bones."</p>

    <li class="r2qhead"><h2>Hollow Crown.</h2></li>

    <div class="r2main">
    <p>"For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground
        And tell sad stories of the <strong>death of kings</strong>;
        How some have been deposed; some slain in war,
        Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed;
        Some poison'd by their wives: some sleeping kill'd;
        All <strong>murder'd</strong>: for within the hollow crown
        That rounds the mortal temples of a king
        Keeps <strong>Death</strong> his court."</p>
